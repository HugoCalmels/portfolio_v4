I can also develop a custom interface (like a mini CMS), connected to a database. See the \"Domain + DB + maintenance\" offer.\n\nYou choose what suits you best."
    },
    {
      "question": "2. Can I request changes after delivery?",
      "answer": "Yes. Small occasional changes (texts, images, colors) are possible free of charge for a few days after delivery.\n\nBeyond that or for bigger changes (extra pages, new sections, features), I offer a quote based on required time."
    },
    {
      "question": "3. Who owns the site after delivery?",
      "answer": "Once the site is paid for, it belongs to you: the code, texts, and images are in your name.\n\nIf I manage hosting or domain, I remain responsible for technical aspects. The site can be transferred anytime if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "4. Will the site be mobile-friendly?",
      "answer": "Yes. All sites I develop are responsive: they adapt automatically to phones, tablets, and desktops."
    },
    {
      "question": "5. Will the site be well visible on Google from launch?",
      "answer": "Yes, the site is technically optimized for Google (tags, speed, structure, clear content).\n\nStarting from a good audit and targeted keywords, natural ranking can be excellent even without monthly updates."
    },
    {
      "question": "6. Do you offer SEO follow-up after delivery?",
      "answer": "Yes, it’s possible. In competitive markets, staying well-ranked requires real follow-up: regular content, backlinks, SEO strategy.\n\nI can offer occasional audits or monthly support, depending on your needs and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "7. What exactly does the base offer include?",
      "answer": "It covers essentials: custom design, content writing, development, mobile version, and basic SEO.\n\nIt’s a simple, efficient offer designed for showcase sites. Domain and hosting are optional."
    },
    {
      "question": "8. How long does it take to make a site?",
      "answer": "A simple site can be ready in 3 to 10 business days.\n\nBut each project is different: complex web apps with specific features may take weeks or months."
